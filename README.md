Custom-built plotting device that came to life with the help of the Lego EV3. 

# Explanation

A rack and pinion design allows the plotter, which is driven by two lego EV3 motors, to move along an X-Y Plane and plot pictures with ease. The racks were made designed using SolidWorks and printed using a 3D-printer. C++ was the language used to interact with the Lego EV3 so that the motors could be programmed to plot a picture by just using a text file of (X, Y) coordinates.
